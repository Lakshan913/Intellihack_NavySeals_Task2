Customer Segmentation Project
Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers of an e-commerce platform based on their behavior. The dataset contains information about customer interactions, purchases, and browsing patterns. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments (clusters) using clustering techniques and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.

total_purchases: Total number of purchases made by the customer.

avg_cart_value: Average value of items in the customer's cart.

total_time_spent: Total time spent on the platform (in minutes).

product_click: Number of products viewed by the customer.

discount_count: Number of times the customer used a discount code.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Copy
customer-segmentation/
├── data/
│   └── customer_data.csv          # Dataset file
├── notebooks/
│   └── customer_segmentation.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with the analysis
├── results/
│   └── customer_segmentation_results.csv  # CSV file with cluster labels
├── README.md                      # This file
Steps to Reproduce
1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2. Load the Dataset
Place the dataset (customer_data.csv) in the data/ folder. The dataset will be loaded in the Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the customer_segmentation.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells step-by-step. The notebook includes the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data and check for missing values.

Data Preprocessing: Standardize the data for clustering.

Model Selection: Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Clustering: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers.

Analysis: Analyze and visualize the clusters.

Save Results: Save the cluster labels to a CSV file.

4. View the Results
The results of the clustering analysis are saved in the results/ folder as customer_segmentation_results.csv. This file contains the original dataset with an additional column (cluster_label) indicating the segment each customer belongs to.

Key Findings
Customer Segments
The customers were segmented into 3 clusters:

Bargain Hunters:

High total_purchases and discount_count.

Low avg_cart_value.

Moderate total_time_spent and product_click.

High Spenders:

Moderate total_purchases.

High avg_cart_value.

Low discount_count.

Window Shoppers:

Low total_purchases.

High total_time_spent and product_click.

Low discount_count.

Visualizations
Pairplot: Visualizes the relationships between features, colored by cluster.

Boxplot: Shows the distribution of each feature across clusters.

Usage
The results of this analysis can be used to:

Targeted Marketing: Develop personalized marketing strategies for each segment.

Customer Retention: Identify high-value customers and implement retention strategies.

Product Recommendations: Recommend products based on customer behavior.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
